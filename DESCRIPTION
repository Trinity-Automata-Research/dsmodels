Description: An expressive language to facilitate the creation and visualization
    of two-dimensional dynamical systems. The basic elements of the language are
    a model wrapping around a function(x,y) which outputs a list(x
    = xprime, y = yprime), and a range. The language supports three
    types of visual objects: visualizations, features, and backgrounds. Visualizations, including dots and arrows,
    depict the behavior of the dynamical system over the entire range.
    Features display
    user-defined curves and points, and their images under the system.
    Backgrounds define and color regions of interest, such as areas of convergence and divergence.
    The language
    can also automatically guess attractors and regions of convergence and divergence.
